# Heteropolymer fit

This directory contains python files that perform fits on NRXC-type capped heteropolymer repeat proteins.  

There are three separate .py files for data conversion, generation of fitting equations, and fitting and 
downstream processing (plotting, boostrapping, statistical analysis, and parameter correlation).

In addition, there is a single jupyter .ipynb notebook that combines all of these functions.  

Finally, there are two combined csv data sets for fitting.  One contains only NRC-type repeats (the same
data included in the homopolymer fitting folder, and the other contains X-type repeats with a threonine to valine
substitution.  The data conversion script defines these two csv files.
