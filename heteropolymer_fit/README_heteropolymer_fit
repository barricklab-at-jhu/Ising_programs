This directory contains python files that perform fits on NRXC-type capped heteropolymer repeat proteins.  

There are three separate .py files for data conversion, generation of fitting equations, and fitting and 
downstream processing (plotting, boostrapping, statistical analysis, and parameter correlation).

In addition, there is a single jupyter .ipynb notebook that combines all of these functions.  

Finally, there are two combined csv data sets for fitting.  One contains only NRC-type repeats (the same
data included in the homopolymer fiting folder, and the other contains X-type repeats with a threonine to valine
substitution.  The data conversion script defines these two csv files.  

When fitting, the directory that houses these data should be used as the path in each script (usually I put 
versions of the script(s) in the same folder, so they have I can reviewany post-fit settings at a later time).

These run in python 2.7
