This is a series of scripts for Ising analysis of homopolymeric NRC-type repeats.  There are three separate .py files
for data conversion, generation of fitting equations, and fitting and downstream processing (plotting, boostrapping,
statistical analysis, and parameter correlation).

In addition, there is a single jupyter .ipynb notebook that combines all of these functions.  

Finally, there is a set of data in its own folder for fitting.  When fitting, the directory that houses these data should be 
used as the path in each script (usually I put versions of the script(s) in the same folder, so they have I can review
any post-fit settings at a later time).

These run in python 2.7
