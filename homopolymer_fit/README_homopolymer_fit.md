# Homopolymer fit

This is a series of scripts for Ising analysis of homopolymeric NRC-type repeats.  There are three separate .py files
for data conversion, generation of fitting equations, and fitting and downstream processing (plotting, boostrapping,
statistical analysis, and parameter correlation).

In addition, there is a single jupyter .ipynb notebook that combines all of these functions.
