The scripts in this folder merget two csv files containing multiple melts (usually of different 
construct types) and merges them to a singe csv file, and also outputs each individual melt as
a numpy file.  It also generates melts and constructs files for fitting.

I have also included two csv data files to merge.

Run with python 2.7
