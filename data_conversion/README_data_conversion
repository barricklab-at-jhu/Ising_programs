This directory contains folders for two modified data conversion scripts.  The first combines csv 
files with multiple melts, which we use for construt series of different types (e.g., NRC and NRXC) 
and coverts to a set of numpy files, one for each melt.  The second takes a single csv file and converts
to numpy files, one for each melt.
